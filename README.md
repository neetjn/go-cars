# go-cars

This project was created to learn Golang basics, as well as common use cases from other languages I use on a daily basis. I'll be recording my experiments and what I've learned while treking through Go. 

## Experiments

* [x] Create a local package, module, or library and utilize it in our entry point.
* [x] Read from a file in a local directory.
* [x] Create a basic DTO (data transfer object).
* [x] Marshal and unmarshal DTO to string and Go structure.
* [ ] Expose REST endpoints for the experiment application.
* [ ] Use a go routine.
* [ ] Dockerize application.
* [ ] Create unit tests and execute on a CI/CD platform.
